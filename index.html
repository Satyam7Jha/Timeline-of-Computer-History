              A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out
              sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation)
              automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform
              generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs
              enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer
              system is a nominally complete computer that includes the
              hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral
              equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also
              refer to a group of computers that are linked and function
              together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
